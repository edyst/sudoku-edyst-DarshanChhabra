# sudoku
A Note: just so you know the Difficulty Buttons works fine as long as you have not inputed into cells. You will have to click on reset if you have inputed into any cell, this algorithm was created so that the user does not accidently change difficulty during the current session as it will result in user loosing all the Session data.
